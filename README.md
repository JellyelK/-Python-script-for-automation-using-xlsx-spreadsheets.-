# Python Automation Script using XLSX Spreadsheets

This project showcases a Python automation script I have been developing. The script is designed to analyze data from an xlsx spreadsheet and automatically fill forms. In this example, I used Google Forms with some questions from a client registration form on a law firm's website.

Using the pandas and PyAutoGUI libraries, the script efficiently analyzes the data present in each row of the spreadsheet and fills in this data in the configured form fields.

## Features

- Analyzes data from an xlsx spreadsheet.
- Automates form filling for client registration using Google Forms.
- Utilizes pandas for data analysis and PyAutoGUI for automating form field input.

## Requirements

- Python
- Pandas library
- PyAutoGUI library

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```
    pip install pandas pyautogui
    ```
3. Run the Python script `main.py`.
4. configure and execute the automation.

Feel free to explore and modify the script as needed for your automation tasks!
